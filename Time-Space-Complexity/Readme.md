Time Complexity -> the number of operations performed by your code.
  . This time complexity is defined as a function of the input size n using Big-O notation, n indicates the input size, while O is the worst-case scenaio growth rate function.
  . We use Bit-O notation to classify algorithm based on their running time
  . Worst case O(n)
  . Average case O((n+1)/2)
  . Best Case O(1)
